A testing environment for HERACoin


HERACoin is primarily thought of a cryptocurrency specifically designed for refugee / migrant populations to carry their assets wherever they go. As normal currencies of assets (money in bank, physical assets like house or car) cannot be carried, especially in the event of a forced displacement.

Main uses of HERACoin is thought of as following:
1. A platform enabling the user to carry their financial assets everywhere, without the risk of being forced out by a government or another entity.
2. A safe and anonymous way of donating to the people directly, without any intermediaries (such as non-profits). 
3. A conditional credit transfer platform for potential health related interventions for the target populations. 
4. A safe exchange platform that can be used in refugee camps.
